Sadato was the son of Abe no Yoritoki, the chinjufu-sh\u014dgun (general in charge of overseeing the Ainu and the defense of the north). In the Zenkunen War, Sadato fought alongside his father against the Minamoto.Minamoto no Yoriyoshi and his son Yoshiie came to the Abe's northern province of Mutsu to restore power over the province to the Governor; Abe no Yoritoki, Sadato's father, had been acting beyond his station. As a result, the two clans fought for roughly nine years, with some truces, over the course of a total of twelve years from 1051 to 1063.Sadato's father was killed in 1057, and so he became head of the clan and head of the military effort against the Minamoto. He fought them in the battle of Kawasaki, in a snowstorm, defeated them and pursued them through the blizzard for a short time. Other battles followed, during which Sadato's attacks, along with the harsh weather and terrain weakened his enemies. However, in 1062, the Minamoto received reinforcements, and Sadato faced them for the last time. He came under siege in a fortress on the Kuriyagawa, and after several days of fighting, his water supply diverted, his defenses attacked, and his fortress set aflame, Sadato surrendered. The Minamoto returned to Kyoto the following year, carrying his head.\"He was more than six feet tall, the circumference of his waist seven feet and four inches.  He had an extraordinary face, his skin was white, and he was fat.\"Famed director Akira Kurosawa claimed in his autobiography to be a descendant of Abe no Sadato."

It is the sequel to Dragon Ball  and adapts the latter 325 chapters of the original 519-chapter Dragon Ball manga series created by Akira Toriyama which ran in Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump from 1988-1995. Dragon Ball Z aired in Japan on Fuji TV from April 26, 1989 to January 31, 1996, before getting dubbed in territories including the United States, Canada, Australia, Europe, India, and Latin America. It was broadcast in at least 81 countries worldwide. It is part of the Dragon Ball media franchise.Dragon Ball Z continues the adventures of Goku, who, along with his companions, defend the Earth against villains ranging from aliens (Frieza), androids (Cell) and other creatures (Majin Buu).  While the original Dragon Ball anime followed Goku from childhood to early adulthood, Dragon Ball Z is a continuation of his adult life, but at the same time parallels the life of his son, Gohan, as well as the development of his rival Vegeta.Due to the success of the anime in the United States, the manga chapters making up its story were initially released by Viz Media under the Dragon Ball Z title. Dragon Ball Z's popularity has spawned numerous releases which have come to represent the majority of content in the Dragon Ball franchise; including 15 movies, 2 TV specials, and 148 video games (many of them being only released in Japan), and a host of soundtracks stemming from this material. Dragon Ball Z remains a cultural icon through numerous adaptations and re-releases, including a more-recent remastered broadcast titled Dragon Ball Kai. There have also been two sequel series; Dragon Ball GT (1996\u20131997) and Dragon Ball Super (2015\u20132018)."

Whilst the resolutions were both approved by a majority of voters, they did not receive the approval from the majority of cantons, so were rejected, as was the law on troops.The next two referendums were held on 25 September on abolishing price reductions on breadstuffs and an amendment to the Strafgesetzbuch and the military penal code, both of which were approved.

The narrative centers on a single character: Jean des Esseintes, an eccentric, reclusive, ailing aesthete. The last scion of an aristocratic family, Des Esseintes loathes nineteenth century bourgeois society and tries to retreat into an ideal artistic world of his own creation. The narrative is almost entirely a catalogue of the neurotic Des Esseintes' aesthetic tastes, musings on literature, painting, and religion, and hyperaesthesic sensory experiences.\u00c0 rebours contains many themes that became associated with the Symbolist aesthetic. In doing so, it broke from Naturalism and became the ultimate example of \"Decadent\" literature, inspiring works such as Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray (1890). In his preface for the 1903 publication of the novel, Huysmans wrote that he had the idea to portray a man \"soaring upwards into dream, seeking refuge in illusions of extravagant fantasy, living alone, far from his century, among memories of more congenial times, of less base surroundings ... each chapter became the sublimate of a specialism, the refinement of a different art; it became condensed into an essence of jewellery, perfumes, religious and secular literature, of profane music and plain-chant.\""

It was built in 1885 and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.St. Thomas is the oldest Catholic parish in Beloit, with roots going back to 1846, when the parishioners were largely Irish immigrants worshiping in the home of Captain Thomas and Lucy Power, where City Hall now stands. In 1854 the parish built a stone church, in which they worshiped for thirty years until it burned in 1884. Reverend J.W. Ward set right to work raising funds for a new building, partly by giving a series of temperance lectures.The new church was built from 1885 to 1886 on the site of the stone church. James J. Egan of Chicago designed a simply massed rectangular building with a gable roof and a square corner tower, with fine details. The walls are cream brick, with brick buttresses and stone trim. The porches are in Stick style, an unusual choice for a church like this. The windows are tall, with arches slightly pointed, a typical Gothic detail. A circle-within-the-arch motif repeats in many windows. Many buttresses lead up to little towers with gablets on top. The big corner tower has its own corner gablets, then a belfry with a rose window, then a spire reaching 150 feet, topped with a cross.Inside, the auditorium is 118 feet long and fifty-five feet wide, with an arcade of stained glass windows. Behind the altar is another large, elaborate stained glass window. The ceiling is supported by wooden trusses. The church was built by masons Marshall and Sweet, carpenters Cummingham Brothers, and stonecutter A.S. Jackson, all from Beloit."

Both areas had previously seen major changes in 1966, with Walsall County Borough being expanded to cover areas formerly administered by the Municipal Boroughs of Bilston and Wednesbury, as well as the Urban Districts of Coseley, Darlaston, Willenhall and Wednesfield. However, in all cases only parts of those areas were transferred into the County Borough, with other areas being moved into different authorities. Aldridge-Brownhills Urban District was created from the majority of the former Urban Districts of Aldridge and Brownhills, along with some smaller areas from other local authorities.Walsall Metropolitan Borough Council was assessed by the Audit Commission in 2008 and judged to be \"improving well\" in providing services for local people. Overall the council was awarded \"three star\" status meaning it was \"performing well\" and \"consistently above minimum requirements\", similar to 46% of all local authorities.The council offices are located at the Civic Centre in the heart of Walsall. Elections to the council take place in three out of every four years, with one-third of the seats being contested at each election. Between its formation in 1974 and the 2003 election, the council varied between control by the Labour Party, and where no one party had an overall majority. From 2003 to the 2011 election the Conservative Party then held a majority of councillors. However, in 2011 Labour made eight gains, including 5 from the Conservatives and as a result the council came under no overall control, with the Conservatives continuing as a minority administration.As of 2018, the number of councillors held by the Conservative group (30) exactly matches the number held by Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the Independents combined (30). Therefore the re-appointed mayor used his deciding vote in favour of the Conservatives."

Five percent of the royalties of that book were planned to be contributed to the Rosie Jimenez Fund of financial assistance to poor people wishing to have abortions in Texas.A 1995 compilation album issued by 550 Music/Epic Records called Spirit of '73: Rock For Choice was put together by the activist group Feminist Majority, and the liner notes state that the proceeds of the album went to supporting the Becky Bell/Rosie Jimenez Campaign \"to lift consent laws and federal funding restrictions that are forcing young women to turn to back-alley abortions\". Since 1995, the Abortion Access Project has organized Rosie Jimenez Day every October 3, as well as sponsored speak-outs and other events every year that month to remember her.Activism of the Socialist Party of Massachusetts includes, among other things, annual demonstrations to mark Rosie Jimenez Day."

The Patriots ended the season with a record of three wins and eleven losses and finished last in the AFC East Division. The Patriots continued their period of futility as they slumped to another horrendous record of 3\u201311, and missed the playoffs for the 9th straight season. After getting embarrassed 31\u20137 in their home opener against Cincinnati, the Patriots would win their next 2 games against Atlanta and Washington. However, the Patriots would continue their midseason misery, as they would lose 9 straight games to slide to 2\u201310 before winning their first (and only) road game against the New Orleans Saints. New England went winless against AFC opponents. Besides their embarrassing home-opening loss, the Patriots had plenty of other bad moments during the season. One good example was a 52\u20130 thrashing given to them by the powerful Miami Dolphins. The loss went down as the worst loss in Patriots history and the most points ever allowed in a game in franchise history. Although they won three games, the 1972 Patriots had the second-worst point differential (minus-254) of any team in a 14-game NFL season, ahead of only the expansion 1976 Buccaneers. The 1972 Patriots had the franchise\u2019s worst point differential until the 1990 team was outscored by 265 points (181\u2013446) in a 1\u201315 season. They lost eight of their fourteen games by three touchdowns or more, and their first two wins were by a single point. Pro Football Reference argues that the 1970 and 1972 Patriots were, owing to the tough schedule of the 1990 team, the weakest Patriot teams ever, and rivalled only by the 1991 Colts and 2009 Rams as the weakest team by an established franchise since the NFL\u2013AFL merger."

The loch used to be a popular venue for skaters, with the Edinburgh Skating Club meeting there, but is now rarely sufficiently iced.There are carp in the loch, allegedly reaching up to 20 pounds (9.1 kg) in size, as well as populations of roach, perch and pike.In 1778, a hoard of fifty-three Late Bronze Age weapons was dredged from the loch; it is now held by the National Museum of Scotland."

Vullo revolutionized the role of the setter, because he was, along with the Dutch Peter Blang\u00e9, one of the first setters in the world to be 1.98m tall, which allowed him to set the ball from a greater height and to be dangerous in attack, block and serve.Before Vullo and Blang\u00e9, most of the setters were much shorter (usually not taller than 1.90 m), but nowadays it is common to see setters who are over 2.00m tall, and are effective blockers and servers.Despite being unanimously considered as one of world's best setters ever, Vullo was rarely capped by the Italian national team, due to his conflictual relationship with coach Julio Velasco, and therefore he did not take part in much of the victories of that team during the 1990s: with the Italian national team, he only won one World League, in 1992.On the other hand, Vullo had a long and very successful career at club level in the Italian Serie A1: he won 8 Italian titles, 7 Champions Leagues (4 with Modena, 3 with Ravenna), one European Champions cup, and other less important trophies, both in Italy and in Europe.Vullo stopped playing in 2004, and is currently working as TV commentator."

The season set a record in winning percentage and they won the NBA Finals for the franchise's second championship and first in Philadelphia. The team was later chosen as the greatest individual team in 1980 for the NBA 35th Anniversary Team.During the off-season, the 76ers dismissed coach Dolph Schayes of Syracuse Nationals fame. Alex Hannum, the former 1950s power forward, who was the last man to coach a winner past Boston, was the new coach. The 43-year-old Hannum looked like he could still play, and often ran with the club in practice.Wilt Chamberlain's eight assists per game set a record for centers and made him third in the NBA overall, while scoring 24 per game and again leading the NBA in rebounds and blocked shots.Shooting less, he made a league-record 68% of his shots; his 875 free throw attempts, another league record, offset his percentage from the foul line.The 76ers also had three other players around the 20-point-per-game mark that season in Hal Greer with 22 points, and Chet Walker and Billy Cunningham, both with 19 points. The four players combined won a then-league-record 68 games together under Hannum's watch. The team averaged a record 125 points per game, leading all teams in shooting accuracy.The 76ers started the season at 46\u20134, which remains the best 50-game start in the NBA history (tied in 2016). They finished the season at 68\u201313, the best record in league history at the time. In the first round of the playoffs, they defeated the Royals in four games, then in the Eastern Conference Finals defeated the Boston Celtics, a team who had won eight consecutive titles, and nine out of the last ten, four games to one. In the finals they defeated the San Francisco Warriors, four games to two.In 1996, the 1966-67 76ers were named as one of the Top 10 Teams in NBA History."

My hard drive with all my music was stolen in my car one fine afternoon in Stockholm, the very same fine afternoon we came home from our US tour, the very same day I was feeling thrilled to come home and start the process of finishing our new album. Of course I had made a backup copy on my computer at home. But for some reason a power failure in the building made that hard drive collapse too. Unbelievable.

It featured two album tracks (\"Dare\" and \"God Knows I Had Plans\") and an exclusive non-album track (\"Kicks\"). Ekstr\u00f6m said of the album's name: \"The title Islands came up because I see the tracks on the album as small islands in different shapes and forms where every song is like a record of it's  [sic] very own. Johan on Labrador Records suggested the same title without having heard me mentioning the idea, so that was a coincidence too good not to pursue. The songs are almost too personal and I've had a hard time playing them for friends. It's like all I want to do is keep them to myself\"."

        "description": "Metrication (or metrification) is the process of introducing the International System of Units, also known as SI units or the metric system, to replace a jurisdiction's traditional measuring units. Although U.S. customary units have been defined in terms of metric units since the 19th century, as of 2019 the United States is one of only three countries (the others being Myanmar and Liberia) that have not officially adopted the metric system as the primary means of weights and measures.The United States has official legislation for metrication; however, conversion was not mandatory and many industries chose not to convert, and unlike other countries, there is no governmental or major social desire to implement further metrication.Although customary units are used more often than metric units in the U.S., the SI system is used extensively in some fields such as science, medicine, the military, automobile production and repair, and international affairs. Post-1994 federal law also mandates most packaged consumer goods be labeled in both customary and metric units."

However, the island is prone to earthquakes and its steep cliffs cause numerous landslides. By 1920, the danger to the lighthouse was considered great enough to trigger a decision to move the lighthouse to the mainland. In 1922, the lighthouse was extinguished and relocated to its current position.On 10 June 2019, the name of the island was officially gazetted as Whangakeno / East Island."

Due to the structure of the Everest Massif, its high summit is blocked by Nuptse from much of the surrounding region. The views of Everest, Nuptse and Changtse are spectacular from Kala Patthar and there are glimpses of the northern flank and summit of Lhotse.

        "description": "In folklore, a simpleton is a person whose foolish actions are the subject of often-repeated stories. Simpletons are also known as noodles, fools, and gothamites.  Folklore often holds, with no basis in fact, that certain towns or countries are thought to be home to large numbers of simpletons. The ancient Greeks told tales of stupid populations in Abdera and other cities; in Germany, men of Schilda are conspicuous in these stories; in Spain hundreds of jokes exist about the supposed foolishness of the people from Lepe; and in England, the village of Gotham in Nottinghamshire is reputed to be populated by simpletons. In Sri Lanka whole districts in the central, southern, and western provinces are credited with being the abode of foolish people.Tales of simpleton behavior have often been collected into books, and early joke books include many simpleton jokes. In ancient Greece, Hierokles created such a collection. In England, the famous Joe Miller's Jests is highly inclusive of simpleton jokes. In Britain the Irish are often stereotyped as stupid   and are the butt of An Englishman, an Irishman and a Scotsman jokes. Books of simpleton tales exist in Persia, Ireland, Turkey, Iceland, Japan, Sicily, and India.Simpleton tales are huge in number, but many of them share the same notions of simple-minded behavior. Many are repeated, with altered names, settings, characters, etc., in language after language and collection after collection. A very old such tale from England isThere was a man of Gotham that rode to the market with two bushels of wheat, and because his horse should not be damaged by carrying too great a burden, he was determined to carry the corn himself upon his own neck, and still kept riding upon his horse till he arrived at the end of his journey. Now I will leave you to judge which was the wisest, his horse or himself.A famous one from ancient Greece isA man's father having died, the son dutifully took the body to the embalmers. When he returned at the appointed time to take it, there happened to be a number of bodies in the same place, so he was asked if his father had any peculiarity by which his body might be recognised, and the simpleton replied, \"He had a cough.\""

        "description": "Fenchurch Street railway station, also known as London Fenchurch Street, is a central London railway terminus in the southeastern corner of the City of London. It takes its name from its proximity to Fenchurch Street, a key thoroughfare in the City. The station and all trains are operated by c2c. Services run on lines built by the London and Blackwall Railway (L&BR) and the London, Tilbury and Southend Railway (LTSR) to destinations in east London and south Essex, including Upminster, Grays, Basildon, Southend and Shoeburyness.The station opened in 1841 to serve the L&BR and was rebuilt in 1854 when the LTSR, a joint venture between the L&BR and the Eastern Counties Railway (ECR), began operating. The ECR also operated trains out of Fenchurch Street to relieve congestion at its other London terminus at Bishopsgate. In 1862 the Great Eastern Railway was created by amalgamating various East Anglian railway companies (including the ECR) and it shared the station with the LTSR until 1912, when the latter was bought by the Midland Railway. The station came under ownership of the London & North Eastern Railway (LNER) following the Railways Act 1921, and was shared by LNER and London Midland & Scottish Railway (LMS) services until nationalisation in 1948. The line from the station was electrified in 1961, and controversially closed for seven weeks in 1994.Fenchurch Street is one of the smallest railway terminals in London in terms of platforms, but one of the most intensively operated. It has no direct interchange with the London Underground. Plans to connect it stalled in the early 1980s because of the lack of progress on the Jubilee line, but it is close to Tower Hill on the Underground and to Tower Gateway on the Docklands Light Railway."

Rasmussen and her colleagues showed that it is a separate species. The same research also confirmed the specific status of the Sangihe white-eye, Zosterops nehrkorni.Compared to related taxa, the bill of Seram white-eye is paler, deeper, and broader at the base. Its eye-ring is narrow and broken at the front. The crown and sides of the head are black and the upperparts are dark bronze. The rump is a distinctive yellow-bronze. The sides of the breast and flanks are greyish-white, the undertail-coverts are orange-yellow, the thighs are whitish, and the uppertail is brownish-black.The sexes are similar, but immatures have the throat greener and more diffuse, with more black mixed into the chin feathers.Its song also differs from that of related species.Though mainly insectivorous, the Seram white-eye will also eat nectar and fruits of various kinds."

It is based in the region of the historical Catalan County of Urgell, though it has different borders.  The seat and Cathedral of the bishop are situated in la Seu d'Urgell town. The state of Andorra is a part of this diocese.Among its most notable events are Bishop Felix's adoptionist revolt, the coup of Bishop Esclua and the overthrowing of the bishop by members of aristocratic families (namely Salla i Ermengol del Conflent, Eribau i Folcs dels Cardona, Guillem Guifr\u00e9 de Cerdanya and Ot de Pallars) between the years 981 and 1122.Also important is the diocese's patronage of Andorra, with the bishop holding the role of ex officio Co-Prince of Andorra jointly with the President of France (and formerly, the King of France). Andorra was ceded to the Bishop of Urgell by the Count Ermengol VI of Urgell in 1133.Up to 1802, the ecclesiastical border corresponded with the royal one established under the Treaty of the Pyrenees in 1659. As such the 33 towns of the northern Cerdanya (now in France) came under the diocese's control."

        "description": "To Have and Have Not is a 1944 American romance-war-adventure film directed by Howard Hawks, loosely based on Ernest Hemingway's 1937 novel of the same name.  It stars Humphrey Bogart, Walter Brennan and Lauren Bacall; it also features Dolores Moran, Hoagy Carmichael, Sheldon Leonard, Dan Seymour, and Marcel Dalio. The plot centers on the romance between a freelancing fisherman in Martinique and a beautiful American drifter, which is complicated by the growing French resistance in Vichy France.Ernest Hemingway and Howard Hawks were close friends and, on a fishing trip, Hawks told Hemingway, who was reluctant to go into screenwriting, that Hemingway could make a great movie from his worst book, which Hawks admitted was To Have and Have Not. Jules Furthman wrote the first screenplay, which was set in Cuba like the novel. However, the screenplay was altered to be set in Martinique instead of Cuba because the portrayal of Cuba's government was believed to be in violation of the United States' Good Neighbor policy with Latin American countries. Hawks's other good friend, William Faulkner, was the main contributor to the screenplay, including and following the revisions. Because of the contributions from both Hemingway and Faulkner, the film represents the only film story on which two winners of the Nobel Prize of Literature worked. Filming began on February 29, 1944, while Faulkner continued to work on the script, and ended on May 10.The film released nationally on October 11, 1944. Audience reception of the film was generally good. Reviews were mixed, with many claiming that the film was a remake of Casablanca (1942). Critics specifically mentioned Lauren Bacall's performance or the chemistry between Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall on screen. Bogart and Bacall began an off-screen relationship during production and married in 1945, after the film's release. To Have and Have Not was one of the top thirty grossing films in 1944 and it received an award from the National Board of Review."

The character was promoted as one of five new main characters to join Torchwood in its fourth series, Torchwood: Miracle Day (2011), as part of a new co-production between Torchwood's British network, BBC One, and its American financiers on US premium television network Starz. Tur appears in the first five of the overall ten episodes, and is credited as a 'special guest star'.The narrative of Miracle Day depicts the effects of an event which halts the process of death worldwide meaning the gravely-wounded continue to remain alive. As an attending surgeon, Vera is amongst the first to realise the significance of events and the associated repercussions. Her morals and professionalism pit her at odds with the increasingly inept medical system and shifting government legislation. After establishing a sexual relationship with Rex Matheson she allies herself with his Torchwood team. However, her first undercover investigation for the group is her last; she is burned alive after dissenting against one of the middle-men in charge of a government run concentration camp.In early episodes the character provides a reference point for viewers in regards to the effects of people who should be dead not dying. To prepare for the role, Tur spent time in a hospital emergency department and shadowed a professional medical doctor. Some critics felt that the character's hands on role enabled the audience to relate more to the crisis; others maintained that she wasn't given enough time to develop. Response to the character's violent death was mixed; some praised the increasingly dark shift whilst others felt it was too evocative of the Holocaust for a TV drama. The writers intent in scripting her demise had been to remind audiences that intense human cruelty is possible in human society."

The 17-year-old Chu was a secretary at a restaurant at whose premises Ip held classes, which he audited. Chu became Yip's formal student in January 1951. As his health was not good, he took a concept-based form of the discipline. He taught select students from all over the world, communicating with English speaking students through body language and hands on demonstration, or was assisted by other Chinese students, since he didn't speak English. Though he considered himself retired, he accepted students for the purpose of passing on his understanding of Nim Lik to ensure its survival.He wrote the book \u300a\u8a60\u6625\u5bf6\u9451\u300b and has produced instructional DVDs.He is known as the 'King of Siu Nim Tao', Wing Chun's most important form and its crucial foundation.

From 1987 to 2008, it was a division of Saatchi & Saatchi, an advertising agency (which acquired Dancer Fitzgerald Sample, the original owners), and would later be acquired by Publicis in 2000. In January 2008, Publicis transferred The Program Exchange from the Saatchi & Saatchi subsidiary to its ZenithOptimedia subsidiary, the logo was then changed to reflect this move. In early 2016, the programexchange.com website was shut down; the shutdown coincided with NBCUniversal's purchase of one of its most prominent clients, DreamWorks Classics.The Program Exchange was a \"barter syndicator,\" distributing programming on behalf of the shows' producers, many of them having their own cash distribution services. Instead of paying a cash fee, television stations who ran those programs agreed to a barter exchange (hence the syndicator name), wherein the station agreed to air a certain number of commercials for various General Mills products per program. This arrangement allowed for the programs to air on stations that may not have large budgets to acquire them. The Program Exchange typically distributed older programming that was no longer widely distributed in syndication, as well as programming designed to meet federal educational/information mandates. The Program Exchange continued to hold distribution rights to the Jay Ward Productions and Total Television archives throughout the exchange's existence; both of those companies' programs were produced at the DFS-owned Gamma Productions studios in Mexico until that studio shut down in 1968.The Program Exchange handled distribution for all titles listed below."

F\u00eated in the United States, but critically less than well-received, Keable moved to Tahiti where he continued to write, producing both novels and theological works, until his death at age 40 of a kidney complaint.Keable was raised in Bedfordshire and educated at Magdalene College, Cambridge. He entered a theological college after graduation and was ordained a priest in 1911. He spent the next several years as a missionary in Africa, stationed on Zanzibar and in Basutoland, before returning to Europe as an army chaplain during the First World War. There, he met and fell in love with a young nurse, Grace Eileen Joly Beresford Buck, a development over which he eventually quit the Church of England and left his wife, Sybil. Returning to England after the war, Keable resigned his ministry and began to write novels: his first, 1921's Simon Called Peter, became a runaway success and launched Keable into a life of literary celebrity. Increasingly disillusioned with the hypocrisies he saw in contemporary British life, he and Buck left Europe for Tahiti in 1922. The couple lived there happily until Buck's death in childbirth in 1924, after which Keable's health began to fade. He nonetheless struck up a later relationship with a Tahitian woman, Ina, with whom he had a son, and continued to publish novels until his death of a kidney condition in 1927.Keable's most famous publication was his first novel, Simon Called Peter, but he produced a prodigious literary output, spanning theological tracts through poetry to travel guides. Simon Called Peter's sequel, Recompense, was made into a film, and his later novels all attracted substantial attention. His writings generally met with much greater popular than critical approbation, and Simon Called Peter was sufficiently incendiary to be banned. The book nonetheless became a contemporary best-seller.Much of Keable's fiction contained autobiographical elements, often centring on his attitudes toward and experience of the Christian religious establishment. As well as these fictional explorations he produced a final, non-fiction work, The Great Galilean, outlining the religious views he developed during a lifetime's uneasy relationship to Anglicanism and Catholicism. He came to believe that the historical Jesus bore little relationship to the Jesus of Christian tradition, and, in The Great Galilean, attempted to reconcile his ambivalence about the orthodoxies of the Church with his enduring belief in an all-loving God. Keable's views earned him many unfavourable reviews and the contempt of the church in which he had practised, but foreshadowed ideas of free love that became prominent later in the 20th century."

After he got out, he grabbed his newly purchased guitar and started to play.

It was first published in the United States in December 1980 by Alfred A. Knopf, and in the United Kingdom in March 1981 by Jonathan Cape. The book was shortlisted for the Booker Prize in 1981.The Sirian Experiments relates directly to the first book in this series, Shikasta, which is the history of the planet Shikasta (an allegorical Earth) under the influence of three galactic empires, Canopus, Sirius and their mutual enemy, Puttiora. Shikasta is told from the Canopean viewpoint. The Sirian Experiments (subtitled The Report by Ambien II, of the Five) tells the story of Shikasta from the Sirian point of view and describes the activities of Sirians on the planet and the strained relations of Sirius with Canopus.Lessing stated in an afterword in the next book in this series that The Sirian Experiments and The Making of the Representative for Planet 8 were inspired by her 50-year fascination with the ill-fated 1910\u201313 Antarctic expedition of Robert Falcon Scott."

        "description": "Roberta Mary Morgan, better known by her married name of Roberta Wohlstetter (August 22, 1912 - January 6, 2007), was one of America's most important historians of military intelligence. Her most influential work is Pearl Harbor: Warning and Decision.  The former Secretary of Defense, Donald Rumsfeld, is said to have required that his aides read it.  Indeed, it was brought up during discussions of intelligence failures leading to the successful al-Qaeda attack on the World Trade Center and Pentagon.She was the daughter of Edmund M. Morgan, Jr., a noted Harvard law professor who helped to simplify the federal rules of civil procedure and to modernize the U.S. code of military justice.  Her husband was the late nuclear strategist Albert Wohlstetter.She was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Ronald Reagan jointly with her husband in 1985.  Reagan said:Roberta Wohlstetter, a generation ahead of her time, asserted her influence in areas dominated by and, in some cases, reserved for men. She rose above all obstacles and has had a profound influence. Her inquiries went to the heart of the system of our society, focusing on essential questions. Her analysis of the problems of terrorism, intelligence, and warning and, with Albert [Wohlstetter], the problem of nuclear deterrence broke new ground and opened new alternatives for policymakers. I daresay that she has blankly enjoyed posing the same penetrating questions to her husband that she has to the intellectual and political leaders of the country. And that is certainly one explanation for the clarity and persuasiveness of his own voluminous words on strategy, politics, and world affairs.Wohlstetter worked for the RAND Corporation, a nonprofit research organization based in Santa Monica, California, from 1948 to 1965 and continued to be a consultant through 2002.Roberta Morgan Wohlstetter died at 4:00 a.m. on January 6, 2007 at New York Hospital in New York City. She was 94 years old. She was survived by her daughter Joan Wohlstetter-Hall."

Service operates on weekdays only, providing AM service from Charlotte Hall and Waldorf to Washington, and PM service from Washington to Waldorf and Charlotte Hall, operating primarily along Maryland Highway 5. The route has stops in the District of Columbia, two stops in Prince George's County (Suitland), and one stop each in Charles (Waldorf) and St. Mary's (Charlotte Hall) counties.Route 903 first started operating in 2001 as a supplement to several other area bus routes where demand for service was high.In 2008, MTA proposed to combine Route 913 with Route 903 in order to provide increased service to the busy M Street corridor, a change that ultimately took place on January 12, 2009. Concern was raised over whether some riders needing to transfer would have to pay a second fare when boarding another bus, but MTA stated that there would be no second fare.This bus route was renumbered to MTA Commuter Bus Route 735."

With approximately 215 to 220 million native speakers and 250 million total speakers, Portuguese is usually listed as the sixth most natively spoken language in the world, the third-most spoken European language in the world in terms of native speakers, and the most spoken language in the Southern Hemisphere. It is also the most spoken language in South America and the second-most spoken in Latin America after Spanish, one of the 10 most spoken languages in Africa and is an official language of the European Union, Mercosur, OAS, ECOWAS and the African Union. The Community of Portuguese Language Countries is an international organization made up of all of the world's officially Lusophone nations."

Tulley (1872\u20131954), who held several turn of the 20th century patents, including a gauge to measure oil. Mr. Tulley was a natural mechanic whose early days were spent as a surveyor's assistant. He then went on to assist in building power and light plants around the midwest before arriving in Albany to form the Albany Automobile Company about 1906. The Albany Runabout had two opposing cylinders and was air-cooled. Up to 850 cars were said to have been built and they were shipped to all parts of the country, with at least one vehicle shipped to England.Marketed as \"the busy man's car\", one of the Albany's main selling points were blue dyed elephant hide seats, which were supposedly guaranteed to last the lifetime of the car."

        "description": "Top Latin Albums is a record chart published by Billboard magazine and is labeled as the most important music chart for Spanish language, full-length albums in the American music market. Like all Billboard album charts, the chart is based on sales. Nielsen SoundScan compiles the sales data from merchants representing more than 90 percent of the U.S. music retail market. The sample includes sales at music stores, the music departments of electronics and department stores, direct-to-consumer transactions, and Internet sales of physical albums or digital downloads. A limited array of verifiable sales from concert venues is also tabulated. To rank on this chart, an album must have 51% or more of its content recorded in Spanish. Listings of Top Latin Albums are also shown on Telemundo's music page through a partnership between the two companies. Before this, the first chart regarding latin music albums in the magazine (Billboard Hot Latin Albums in Texas) was published on December 30, 1972 issue. Then, all Latin music information was featured on the Latin Pop Albums chart, which began on June 29, 1985, and is still running along with the Regional Mexican Albums and Tropical Albums chart. The Latin Pop Albums chart features music only from the pop genre, while the Regional Mexican Albums chart includes information from different genres like duranguense, norte\u00f1o, banda and mariachi, and the Tropical Albums includes different genres particularly salsa, merengue, bachata,  and cumbia. In 2005, another chart; Latin Rhythm Albums was introduced in response to growing number of airplays from reggaeton. On the week ending January 31, 2017, Billboard updated the methodology to compile the Top Latin Albums chart into a multi-metric methodology to include track equivalent album units and streaming equivalent albums units.The first album to appear at number-one on this chart was Mi Tierra by Gloria Estefan on July 10, 1993. This album spent 58 non-consecutive weeks at the top of this chart, a record that stands to date. Mexican singers Marco Antonio Sol\u00eds holds the record for the most number-one albums by an artist overall with 12. Fellow Mexican performers Los Temerarios is the group with the most chart-toppers, eight.Jenni Rivera and Selena are the female artists with the most number-one albums with 7 each. Selena's album Dreaming of You is the only album to peak at number one during three different calendar years (1995\u201397)."

In early 19th Century Wallachia, being a Pandur was a fixed, legally recognized social status - whether or not one was a member of a specific military unit. This social condition had a considerable bearing on the central role played by Pandurs in the  Wallachian uprising of 1821. Two armoured personnel carriers made by the Austrian company Steyr-Daimler-Puch are named after the historical Austrian units: the Pandur I 6x6, and Pandur II 8x8.Four ships have also share a namesake of Pandur units. The first was a ship of the French Navy, Pandour, renamed HMS Pandora after its capture by the Royal Navy in 1795.  The additional British ships were named HMS Pandour."

        "description": "Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 3\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase deficiency is an uncommon form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) resulting from a mutation in the gene for one of the key enzymes in cortisol synthesis by the adrenal gland, 3\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3\u03b2-HSD) type II (HSD3B2). As a result, higher levels of 17\u03b1-hydroxypregnenolone appear in the blood with adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) challenge, which stimulates adrenal corticosteroid synthesis.There is a wide spectrum of clinical presentations of 3\u03b2-HSD CAH, from mild to severe forms. The uncommon severe form results from a complete loss of enzymatic activity and manifests itself in infancy as salt wasting due to the loss of mineralocorticoids. Milder forms resulting from incomplete loss of 3\u03b2-HSD type II function do not present with adrenal crisis, but can still produce virilization of genetically female infants and undervirilization of genetically male infants.  As a result, this form of primary hypoadrenalism is the only form of CAH that can cause ambiguous genitalia in both genetic sexes."

        "description": "Mystical psychosis is a term coined by Arthur J. Deikman in the early 1970s to characterize first-person accounts of psychotic experiences that are strikingly similar to reports of mystical experiences. According to Deikman, and authors from a number of disciplines, psychotic experience need not be considered pathological, especially if consideration is given to the values and beliefs of the individual concerned. Deikman thought the mystical experience was brought about through a \"deautomatization\" or undoing of habitual psychological structures that organize, limit, select, and interpret perceptual stimuli. There may be several causes of deautomatization\u2014exposure to severe stress, substance abuse or withdrawal, and mood disorders.A first episode of mystical psychosis is often very frightening, confusing and distressing, particularly because it is an unfamiliar experience. For example, researchers have found that people experiencing paranormal and mystical phenomena report many of the symptoms of panic attacks.On the basis of comparison of mystical experience and psychotic experience Deikman came to a conclusion that mystical experience can be caused by \"deautomatization\" or transformation of habitual psychological structures which organize, limit, select and interpret perceptional incentives that is interfaced to heavy stresses and emotional shocks. He described usual symptoms of mystical psychosis which consist in strengthening of a receptive mode and weakening of a mode of action.People susceptible to mystical psychosis become much more impressible. They feel a unification with society, with the world, God, and also feel washing out the perceptive and conceptual borders. Similarity of mystical psychosis to mystical experience is expressed in sudden, distinct and very strong transition to a receptive mode. It is characterized with easing the subject\u2014object distinction, sensitivity increase and nonverbal, lateral, intuitive thought processes.Deikman's opinion that experience of mystical experience in itself can't be a sign to psychopathology, even in case of this experience at the persons susceptible to neurophysiological and psychiatric frustration, in many respects defined the relation to mystical experiences in modern psychology and psychiatry.Deikman considered that all-encompassing unity opened in mysticism can be all-encompassing unity of reality."

A total of 80,000 copies of almost 80 Rogers Groups were sold across the United States and abroad.At the height of their popularity, Rogers' figurines graced the parlors of homes in the United States and were found as far away as Chile and Australia. The English novelist Charles Reade furnished his home with all the Rogers figurines available to him, and in the Dakota Territory, Lt. Col. George Custer and his wife had one. Often selling for $15 apiece, the figurines were affordable to the middle class.Instead of working in bronze and marble, he sculpted in more affordable plaster, painted the color of putty to hide dust. Rogers was inspired by popular novels, poems and prints as well as the scenes he saw around him."

        "description": "Beta Arae (\u03b2 Ara, \u03b2 Arae) is the brightest star in the constellation Ara, with an apparent visual magnitude of 2.8. Parallax measurements place it at a distance of roughly 650 light-years (200 parsecs) from Earth.The spectrum of this star matches a stellar classification of K3 Ib-IIa, with the luminosity class notation 'Ib-IIa' indicating that the star lies part way between a higher luminosity bright giant (IIa) and a lower luminosity supergiant (Ib). This represents two of the evolutionary stages that a massive star passes through after it has exhausted the hydrogen at its core. Beta Arae is radiating energy from its outer envelope at an effective temperature of 4,200 K, which causes it to take on the orange hue of a K-type star. This enlarged star appears to be rotating slowly with a projected rotational velocity of about 5 km/s. The abundance of elements other than hydrogen and helium, what astronomer term the star's metallicity, is more than three times the abundance in the Sun.Rarely, this star is called by the name Vasat-\u00fcl-cemre in Turkish spelling, derived from the Arabic phrase \u0648\u0633\u0637 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0645\u0631 (wasa\u1e6d al-jamar), meaning \"middle of the embers.\" The constellation Ara is named in Arabic \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062c\u0645\u0631\u0629 (al-mijmarah), meaning the brazier. In Chinese, \u6775 (Ch\u01d4), meaning Pestle, refers to an asterism consisting of \u03b2 Arae, \u03c3 Arae and \u03b1 Arae. Consequently, the Chinese name for \u03b2 Arae itself is \u6775\u4e09 (Ch\u01d4 s\u0101n, English: the Third Star of Pestle.)"

        "description": "At the start of 1958, Billboard magazine published two charts specifically covering the top-performing country music songs in the United States.  The C&W Best Sellers in Stores chart ranked records based on their \"current national selling importance at the retail level\", based on a survey of record retailers \"with a high volume of sales in country and western records\".  The Most Played C&W by Jockeys chart ranked songs based on the \"number of plays on disk jockey radio shows\" according to a weekly survey of \"top disk jockey shows in all key markets\".  With effect from the October 20 issue of Billboard the magazine discontinued both charts and combined sales and airplay into one chart called Hot C&W Sides, which has been published continuously since that date, currently under the title Hot Country Songs.  In 1990 it changed to being based solely on airplay from country music radio stations, before reverting to a combined sales and airplay chart in 2012 but utilizing airplay data from stations of all formats as well as digital sales and streaming.The number one song on the Best Sellers chart in the first issue of 1958 was \"Great Balls of Fire\" by Jerry Lee Lewis, and the song at the top of the Jockeys chart was \"The Story of My Life\" by Marty Robbins.  Eight different singles topped the Best Sellers chart during the year, including two each by Johnny Cash, Don Gibson and The Everly Brothers.  The longest unbroken run in the top spot was eight weeks, achieved by both of Cash's chart-toppers, \"Ballad of a Teenage Queen\" and \"Guess Things Happen That Way\".  The sixteen weeks which Cash spent at number one was the most for any act.  Gibson's \"Oh Lonesome Me\" also spent eight weeks at number one, but in two separate runs.  The song gave Gibson his first number-one country song, the only artist to do so in 1958, and he would go on to achieve his second later in the year, but after the success of \"Blue Blue Day\" he would not return to the top of the country singles chart until 1972.  Three songs which topped the Best Sellers chart did not reach number one on the Jockeys chart: \"Great Balls of Fire\", \"Blue Blue Day\" and \"Bird Dog\" by The Everly Brothers.  The latter two singles were both kept from the number one spot on the Jockeys chart by the thirteen-week reign of \"Alone With You\" by Faron Young, the longest unbroken run of the year on the airplay-based listing.  Despite its popularity on the radio, Young's song was one of two Jockeys chart-toppers never to reach the top spot on the Best Sellers chart, the other being \"Just Married\" by Marty Robbins.The separate sales and airplay charts were published for the final time in the issue of Billboard dated October 13.  The final Best Sellers number one was \"Bird Dog\" and the last Jockeys chart-topper was \"Alone With You\".  The following week the magazine launched the combined Hot C&W Sides chart, based on playlists submitted by country music radio stations and sales reports submitted by stores.  The first number one on the new chart was \"City Lights\" by Ray Price, which in the previous issue had been at number 2 on the Best Sellers chart and number 4 on the Jockeys chart.  Price's song would remain at number one for the remainder of 1958."

A third series of 13 episodes premiered on 4 July 2013.The show follows a student named Axl Johnson, who on his 21st birthday discovers his family members are reincarnated Norse gods. The only problem is, they do not have full control of their powers and it is up to Axl (the reincarnation of Odin) to restore them and ensure the family's survival by finding the reincarnation of Odin's wife, Frigg. Matters are complicated by the presence of several antagonistic or amorously interested Norse deities, given that the Johnsons are not the only such demigods living in exile in New Zealand. At the close of the second series, it is revealed that they are not the only pantheon resident there either, as M\u0101ori deities have also reincarnated, albeit in similarly restricted circumstances."

Bahrain has been known since ancient times as an island with a very large number of burials, the (originally) quite a number of square kilometres of mounds were said to be one of the largest cemeteries in the ancient world. The cemeteries are concentrated in the north of the island, on the hard stony areas slightly above the arable farming soils \u2013 the south of the island is mainly sandy and desert-like. Recent studies have shown that the estimated/approximately 350,000 ancient grave mounds could have been solely produced by the local population over a number of thousands of years. The graves are not all of the same era, or of exactly the same styles, and can vary considerably in size in different areas of the moundfield.  Research, under the auspices of the Bahrain National Museum (with the Bahrain Historical and Archaeological Society taking a keen interest), is still continuing, to establish a firm timeline for all these variations and continuations, as well as considering the implications for the society or societies that produced them."

It is likely situated at the intersection of the northern end of the Long Bar of the Milky Way and the inner portion of the Scutum\u2013Centaurus Arm\u2014one of its two major spiral arms.The age of RSGC3 is estimated at 18\u201324 million years. The 16 detected red supergiant cluster members with masses of about 12\u201315 M\u2609 are type II supernova progenitors. The cluster is heavily obscured and has not been detected in the visible light. It lies close to other groupings of red supergiants known as RSGC1, Stephenson 2 and Alicante 8. The total mass of RSGC3 is estimated at 20 thousand solar masses, which makes it one of the most massive open clusters in the Galaxy.More work has identified a population of at least 30 additional red supergiants in the vicinity of RSGC3, 7 of which are tightly grouped and have been assumed to form a cluster name Alicante 7.  The number of red supergiants identified in the several small areas studied in this region of the sky forms a significant fraction of all those known in the galaxy, suggesting very unusual properties for the region near the end of the galactic bar."

The lamb is a common metaphor for Jesus Christ, who is also called \"The Lamb of God\" in John 1:29.This poem has a simple rhyme scheme: AA BB CC DD AA\u2003 AA EF GG FE AA. The layout is set up by two stanzas with the refrain: \"Little Lamb who made thee / Dost thou know who made thee\". In the first stanza, the speaker asks the lamb who his creator is; the answer lies at the end of the poem. Here we find a physical description of the lamb, seen as a pure and gentle creature. In the second stanza, the lamb is compared with the infant Jesus, as well as between the lamb and the speaker's soul. In the last two lines, the speaker identifies the creator: God.Like the other Songs of Innocence and Songs of Experience, The Lamb was intended to be sung; William Blake's original melody is now lost.  It was made into a song by Vaughan Williams in his 1958 song cycle Ten Blake Songs, although he described it as \"that horrible little lamb \u2013 a poem that I hate\". It was also set to music by Sir John Tavener, who explained: \"The Lamb came to me fully grown and was written in an afternoon and dedicated to my nephew Simon for his 3rd birthday.\" American poet Allen Ginsberg set the poem to music, along with several other of Blake's poems, in the 1970s."

It is native to Japan (Honsh\u016b and Satunan).The wingspan is 9\u201310 mm.The larvae feed on Euscaphis japonica. There are four or five instars. In the first two instars the larvae have a flat head and feed on sap, and in the third to supposed fifth instars they feed on tissue, with a round head and a cylindrical body as in usual lepidopterous larvae. The mine starts as a tortuous serpentine mine, which is located inside the lower epidermis of a leaf and is whitish in colour. The second instar larva expands the linear mine to an elongated blotch along the leaf-margin. In this stage the mine occupies the lower layer of spongy parenchyma. The larva of the third instar feeds on the whole parenchymal tissues remaining inside the blotch-mine, then makes it into a tentiform type. After the third moult, the larva leaves the mine through a round hole and migrates to another leaf, which it cuts from the edge towards the midrib. This cut edge is rolled to form a cone on the underside of the leaf, then the larva continues to feed inside the cone. When full-grown the larva leaves the cone to pupate. Pupation takes place at a margin of the same leaf or another one. The cocoon is whitish, boat-shaped, without any bubbles on its upper side."

L. madagascariensis is perennial, has culms 50\u2013300 cm (20\u2013118 in) long, and resembles bamboo, to which it is however unrelated. Contrarily to many other species in subfamily Panicoideae, this grass uses C3 photosynthesis. It is only found in the Andringitra Massif of central Madagascar, at elevations of 1,600\u20132,400 m (5,200\u20137,900 ft), and critically endangered.The genus is included in the tribe Paspaleae in a 2015 classification although a phylogenetic study had shown in 2013 that it is isolated within the subfamily Panicoideae and best treated in a separate tribe Lecomtelleae."

This train initially had the Navy Blue livery with a white strip above its windows due to this rake sharing arrangement. With increase in demand of an exclusive train between Bombay and Bhubaneshwar, this train was extended up to Bombay VT in 1994 thus ending the rake sharing arrangement between 2101/2102 Minar Express (which was later replaced by the 2701/02 Hussainsagar Express). After extension this train was renumbered as 1019/1020 in the year 1994. It is one of the oldest trains connecting the eastern and western states of the country.

It includes codes from IETF Request for Comments (RFCs), other specifications, and some additional codes used in some common applications of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). The first digit of the status code specifies one of five standard classes of responses. The message phrases shown are typical, but any human-readable alternative may be provided. Unless otherwise stated, the status code is part of the HTTP/1.1 standard (RFC 7231).The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) maintains the official registry of HTTP status codes.Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) sometimes uses additional decimal sub-codes for more specific information, however these sub-codes only appear in the response payload and in documentation, not in the place of an actual HTTP status code.All HTTP response status codes are separated into five classes (or categories). The first digit of the status code defines the class of response. The last two digits do not have any class or categorization role. There are five values for the first digit:1xx (Informational): The request was received, continuing process2xx (Successful): The request was successfully received, understood and accepted3xx (Redirection): Further action needs to be taken in order to complete the request4xx (Client Error): The request contains bad syntax or cannot be fulfilled5xx (Server Error): The server failed to fulfill an apparently valid request"

The park operated from 1923 to 1977, at which time it was closed due to lack of attendance to the park and storm damage in late 1977.Marcia Brancato Accurso's grandfather, Salvatore \u201cSam\u201d Brancato, a Sicilian immigrant and blacksmith by trade, came to the United States in 1896. After settling in Kansas City, he went into the grocery business, then began buying up real estate. He opened Fairyland Park in 1923. It would be in the family until its closing in 1977.  A year after \"Sam\"s passing in 1976.  Admission to blacks was only to private groups and employees, until 1964. After protest marches, demonstrations and arrests for blocking the entrance, was general admission not segregated. Admission cost to the park was kept low (25 cents by 1971). A storm in late 1977, which by some accounts was 'a wind storm', and by others 'a tornado', caused extensive damage to the park. This, combined with the nearby park Worlds of Fun caused the venerable park to shutter for good.During the 1950s and 1960s, Fairyland boasted 3 roller coasters, an 8 story Ferris wheel(which was bent in half during tornado), a swimming pool(double Olympic size)(closed in late 50's), bumper cars, a shooting range, and even a petting zoo at one time. \"Sam\" loved children smiling, and bought the \"Kiddeland\" at 85th & Wornall, moving the rides to Fairyland. Fairyland and its owners tried a number of gimmicks throughout their later days trying to compete with the newer and shinier Worlds of Fun built in 1972. Summer Jams included REO, Dr. Hook, Blue Oyster cult, Charlie Daniels, and many others in the final summers. In 1967 arsonist failed to burn the wooden rollercoaster, The Brancato family commissioned the construction of a new roller coaster, The Wildcat, in 1967. It would not be enough. The Wildcat was the park's biggest ride, and helped the park stay competitive. Other promotions included advertising saying \"Where \"Fun\" is Still Affordable\", keeping their admission at fifty cents while Worlds of Fun was charging five dollars, in addition to parking.With attendance dwindling, the park suffered major storm damage in the winter of 1977\u20131978, and never reopened. Whether or not the park really was destroyed was always questioned, with some believing the park was just deciding to shut down and needing a reason. The Brancato family tried unsuccessfully to redevelop The Fairyland parcel as many things after the park closed, a swap meet and a zoo were mentioned. But in the end, the park would never again entertain guests."

        "description": "Spinoloricus cinziae is an animal species described in 2014 in the phylum Loricifera.It is the first animal species described that does not require oxygen at any point during its life. The species, along with two other newly discovered species, Rugiloricus nov. sp. and Pliciloricus nov. sp., were found in the sediment of the anoxic L'Atalante basin of the Mediterranean Sea.Electron microscope images show that the species' cellular innards appear to be adapted for a zero-oxygen life. Their mitochondria appear to act as hydrogenosomes, organelles which provide energy in some anaerobic single-celled creatures.With a visual resemblance to tiny cups with tentacles sticking out, the species has been said to look like something out of a Dr. Seuss book.At adulthood, this species is characterized by a mouth cone with eight oral ridges, a neck with eight single trichoscalids alternating with seven double trichoscalids, as well as lorical plates with spikes located at the corners.More than 30 species in this group have been described."

She attended The Perse School in Cambridge, but began taking dance when she attended Northwood College. In 1927 she and Doris McBride open their own dance school in Leeds. It was here that Lloyd met student Betty Farrally(n\u0081\u00e9e Hey) who would accompany Lloyd to Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada in 1938.  They opened the Canadian School of Ballet on Portage Avenue and shortly afterwards founded the Winnipeg Ballet Club, that in 1953 became the Royal Winnipeg Ballet. The first performance of the Winnipeg Ballet Club was part of a production celebrating the visit of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth to Winnipeg in May, 1939. Lloyd also founded the dance program at the Banff School of Fine Arts (now The Banff Centre) in 1948. She choreographed 36 works between 1939 and 1952.  Her choreographic notes were destroyed in a fire at the Royal Winnipeg Ballet in 1954. Although she received the appointment as Director of Ballet, she left Winnipeg in 1950 to move to Toronto, where she established another branch of the Canadian School of Ballet, formed the short-lived Toronto Festival Dancers, and continued her choreography.  Her work Shadow on the Prairie was filmed by the National Film Board in 1954.  Anna Blewchamp successfully enacted a stage reconstruction of Lloyd's The Wise Virgins with help from former dancers in 1992 and the performance was video-recorded. Later Lloyd and Betty Farrally moved to Kelowna in 1958, where they opened a branch of the Canadian School of Ballet. She continued her teaching throughout British Columbia as well as choreographing works for the Kelowna Little Theatre and Vernon Little Theatre. She was also an examiner for the Royal Academy of Dancing.Lloyd was awarded the Order of Canada in 1969, a Fellowship Award from the Royal Academy of Dance in 1979, and the Dipl\u00f4me d\u2019honneur from the Canadian Conference for the Arts in 1989. She received the Governor General's Performing Arts Award for Lifetime Achievement in 1992.Lloyd died in Kelowna in 1993."

The switch may have any number of contacts in multiple contact forms, such as make contacts, break contacts, or combinations thereof.Relays are used where it is necessary to control a circuit by an independent low-power signal, or where several circuits must be controlled by one signal. Relays were first used in long-distance telegraph circuits as signal repeaters: they refresh the signal coming in from one circuit by transmitting it on another circuit. Relays were used extensively in telephone exchanges and early computers to perform logical operations.The traditional form of a relay uses an electromagnet to close or open the contacts, but other operating principles have been invented, such as in solid-state relays which use semiconductor properties for control without relying on moving parts. Relays with calibrated operating characteristics and sometimes multiple operating coils are used to protect electrical circuits from overload or faults; in modern electric power systems these functions are performed by digital instruments still called protective relays.Latching relays require only a single pulse of control power to operate the switch persistently. Another pulse applied to a second set of control terminals, or a pulse with opposite polarity, resets the switch, while repeated pulses of the same kind have no effects. Magnetic latching relays are useful in applications when interrupted power should not affect the circuits that the relay is controlling."

During a stint in the United States Navy from 1918 to 1919, she was called USS West Cohas (ID-3253).West Cohas was built in 1918 for the United States Shipping Board (USSB) as part of the West boats, a series of steel-hulled cargo ships built on the West Coast of the United States for the World War I war effort. She was the 24th ship built by Skinner & Eddy of Seattle, Washington, and was completed in 88 calendar days. She was commissioned into the Naval Overseas Transportation Service (NOTS) of the United States Navy as USS West Cohas (ID-3253) in June 1918. After several overseas trips for the Navy, she was decommissioned in May 1919 and returned to the USSB.West Cohas ran aground off Sable Island in 1925 while trying to assist a vessel in distress, but otherwise had a relatively uneventful merchant career for the USSB. In 1933, she was sold to the Lykes Brothers Steamship Company. In 1939, she collided with the Irish passenger ship Munster, which damaged both vessels. In June 1940, West Cobalt was sold to British interests and renamed Empire Simba.During convoy service in World War II, Empire Simba initially sailed between the United Kingdom and North America carrying cargos of scrap iron from the United States. She was bombed by a German aircraft on 1 March and abandoned. She was towed to port for repairs but was struck by a German land mine dropped in a bombing raid. After six months of repairs, she began sailing roundtrips to Freetown, Sierra Leone. On one return voyage to the UK in July 1944, she collided with another ship in the convoy. After splitting the rest of the war between voyages to North America and Africa, Empire Simba was loaded with chemical weapons in August 1945 and scuttled west of Ireland."

They inhabit inshore waters living near the sea floor at depths from 10 to 128 m (33 to 420 ft), preferring areas with beds of seaweed, shipwrecks, or wharf pilings.  They  spend the winter months in a state of torpor underneath rocks.   They can also be found in the aquarium trade.Often, bergall is mixed in with blackfish (tautog), living on or near the same structures. Much of the food eaten by those bergall living among blackfish are the leftovers from the blackfishes prey.  They can be distinguished from the tautog by their pointed snouts. Bergall are generally smaller, so are usually thrown back by anglers who think they caught a \"short\" tautog. In past years, they have been important commercial fish, but now are considered pests.  They can be confused with black sea bass and other grouper, as well as tautog, for their ability to change color.Tautogolabrus adspersus is currently the only known member of its genus.On May 28, 2015, the NJDEP Division of Fish and Wildlife  officially certified the catch of a new state record saltwater fish, weighing 3 pounds, 2.4 ounces and eclipsing the previous state record by 1.9 ounces.

        "description": "VA-11 HALL-A: Cyberpunk Bartender Action (also sometimes written as Valhalla) is an indie bartender simulation video game with visual novel elements as well as cyberpunk, PC-98 and anime-inspired visuals, developed by Venezuelan studio Sukeban Games and published by Ysbryd Games for Microsoft Windows, OS X, and Linux on June 21, 2016. The PlayStation Vita port was developed by Wolfgame and published by Limited Run Games. The game puts the player in the role of a bartender at the eponymous VA-11 HALL-A, a small bar in a dystopian downtown which is said to attract the \"most fascinating\" of people. The gameplay consists of players making and serving drinks to bar attendees whilst listening to the stories and experiences of these said characters.VA-11 HALL-A contains nonlinear gameplay, with the game's plotline being influenced by the drinks the player makes and how the customers react to them. There are no dialogue options within the game, with making different drinks being the sole way to influence the direction of the story. VA-11 HALL-A features a diverse range of characters that have been described as \"average non-heroes\", with developers noting how they were based on side characters that were never truly fleshed out in movies. Over time, the player begins to know the characters well enough to infer what drinks they want, resulting in an intimate experience.VA-11 HALL-A was originally developed for the Cyberpunk Game Jam of 2014; however, Sukeban Games liked the game so much that they eventually turned it into a full game. The original planned release date of December 2014 has since been moved back multiple times due to delays, including when the developers changed the game engine. VA-11 HALL-A draws heavy influences from old PC-98 games, resulting in a retro yet futuristic look, as well as the developers' own experiences of living in a poorer country. The game's original prototype is downloadable for free on the game's official website, and players who pre-order gain access to a playable yet separate prologue. VA-11 HALL-A has garnered pre-release critical acclaim, while post-game reception was mostly favourable, with positive reception directed at its premise, cast of characters, and music. However, occasional reviewers perceived the game's dialogue as unrealistic and the gameplay as repetitive. A sequel, N1RV Ann-A, is scheduled for a 2020 release."

Her legal guardian from 1725, after her official father was forced to leave the country, he may have been her natural father. He raised her and educated her with care, and he married her in 1741 to his nephew, Charles-Guillaume Le Normant d'\u00c9tiolles, from whom she was separated in 1745 at the request of Louis XV.Thanks to the influence of Madame de Pompadour, Le Normant de Tournehem was made directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral of the B\u00e2timents du Roi in December 1745, succeeding Philibert Orry. He held this post, overseeing royal building works, until his death. \"Without artistic prejudices,\" Fiske Kimball observed, \"he was a man of ability, honesty and simplicity, who devoted himself to efficient administration.\" Le Normant de Tournehem reinstated the post of premier peintre du Roi which had been allowed to lapse, in favour of Charles-Antoine Coypel, upon whose artistic advice he wisely depended. Coypel's own advisors were the comte de Caylus, the brilliant and tireless antiquary and founder of archaeology, who had been an advisor to Orry and was a close friend of the connoisseur Pierre-Jean Mariette, and Abb\u00e9 Leblanc, an early critic of the excesses of the Rococo and an advocate of a chastened simplicity in the arts of design.In his role of director of the B\u00e2timents du Roi, Le Normant de Tournehem oversaw the design and construction of the Ch\u00e2teau de Bellevue, which served as a discreet meeting ground for Madame de Pompadour and the King.At his death, his successor at the B\u00e2timents du Roi was Pompadour's capable and carefully prepared brother, Abel-Fran\u00e7ois Poisson, marquis de Vandi\u00e8res, soon to be awarded the title by which posterity knows him, the Marquis de Marigny."

As result, he was sentenced to three years in prison for subversion. After Wolf claimed that his confession had been forced by physical and psychological pressure, he was prosecuted for false accusation and his punishment was increased by another six months in prison. Wolf then spent more than half a year in isolation or in a special ward in the prison in Minkovice, during which period he lost about twenty kilograms in weight. Due to his failure to meet working standards, Wolf also spent part of the sentence in the prison in Valdice under the strictest supervision.According to the testimony of Wolf's former inmate in Minkovice, he manifested himself as a passionate supporter of the freedom of thought and protection of human rights immediately after he had entered the prison. After he rejected any cooperation, the prison management assigned him to the hardest workplace in the prison. Wolf was unable to meet the required working standards there and also suffered several attacks by violent recidivists. Further escalation of disciplinary sanctions resulted in the transfer to a special ward with the harshest conditions. Wolf was held there for three months. Despite all, Wolf remained a fanatical debater defending his truth. The following stream of disciplinary punishments for \"refusing to work\", often for trumped-up reasons, resulted in him becoming rather withdrawn toward the end of his sentence.Wolf was arrested for the second time on 17 May 1983 for passing information about conditions in Czech prisons to the Austrian Embassy in Prague. He was sentenced for another six years in prison for subversion in cooperation with foreign agents, which was followed by three years of protective supervision. He was again placed in Valdice, where his health worsened considerably; he suffered from chest pain and deterioration of vision.  Appeals by international organizations eventually led to small improvements in his treatment.In 1984, Amnesty International declared him a Prisoner of Conscience. AIUSA campus groups on the San Francisco peninsula took up his case and, with Congressman Tom Lantos and his wife Annette, campaigned for his release, winning extensive news coverage and high level support. Jiri was released at the end of his prison term. On the same day, dissident V\u00e1clav Havel was also released from jail.In 1990, Wolf was invited to the United States, where he presented his case as an example of efficient work by the Amnesty International. He spoke at AIUSA's annual general meeting, held that year in Boston. He also toured the Nashua Street Jail, newly opened after courts deemed the Charles Street Jail unfit, to view prison conditions in America.After his release from prison, Wolf was treated both by Czech and American doctors. However, Wolf still suffers from chronic fatigue syndrome.He still calls for support of political prisoners in undemocratic regimes."

During Papp's tenure, the University's enrollment increased by approximately seventy-five percent, growing from 19,854 to 33,252 undergraduate and graduate students.  Under Papp, the University also significantly increased its research and graduate profile, adding a number of new academic programs (including eleven (11) doctoral degrees) and becoming classified as a Doctoral University with Moderate Research Activity.  In Fall 2015, a University employee alleged the University's director of food services was engaged in fiscal misconduct, leading to an investigation by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation and USG.  Investigations uncovered evidence the University's business office and external foundation were not consistently following USG financial procedures and mandatory reporting of financial misconduct policy.  Termination of several high-ranking University employees followed.  The investigation also contended the University's external foundation prematurely disbursed approximately $577,000 Papp earned in deferred compensation.

The Acmeist poets (Nikolay Gumilyov, Mandelstam, Mikhail Kuzmin, etc.) gathered there to discuss theories of literature, give poetry readings, and perform theatre.  They considered themselves \"'stray dogs' shunted aside by proper aristocratic society\", which led to the name. The cafe was in disrepair for many years and reopened in 2001.Run by proprietor Boris Pronin, out of the cellar of the Dashkov mansion, it opened New Year's Eve, 1911 and was shut down by the authorities in 1915. Its closing was linked to the start of World War I. A key locale for the followers of the emerging acmeist and futurist literary movements, the Stray Dog clientele rejected the symbolist school of thought.The previous salon for St. Petersburg poets had been the Tower. This was the apartment of the symbolist poet Vyacheslav Ivanov, who also influenced Meyerhold's use of theatre. Many of these poets later became patrons of the Stray Dog.Poets/performers at the Stray Dog Caf\u00e9 included Anna Akhmatova, her husband Nikolay Gumilyov, Velimir Khlebnikov, Vladimir Mayakovsky, Marina Tsvetaeva, Boris Pasternak, Sergei Esenin, Mikhail Kuzmin, Osip Mandelstam, and Alexander Blok."

Like his father, Thomas Blanke followed the trade of a haberdasher. He became an alderman in 1572 and served as one of the Sheriffs of London in 1574.He was elected Lord Mayor of London in 1582. He had the misfortune to be elected during a severe outbreak of the plague; due to the pestilence, there was no pageant celebrating his election, and he was not presented to the queen until the next May.Much of his mayoralty was spent dealing with the effects of the plague, and his efforts earned him the appellation of \"The Good Knight\". He died in 1588, at the age of 74, and was buried at St Mary-at-Hill; his wife lived until 1596, being buried in the same tomb. As he had died without issue, his estate at Abbott's Inn passed into the Altham family, who retained it until it was destroyed in the Great Fire of London."

        "description": "\"Segne dieses Kind\" (Bless this child) is a poem in six stanzas by Lothar Zenetti. With different melodies, it became a Christian hymn of the genre Neues Geistliches Lied (NGL), appearing in current German hymnals, usually sung for baptism. The full title is \"Segne dieses Kind und hilf uns, ihm zu helfen\" (Bless this child and help us to help him), which is the beginning of all six stanzas.The first five stanzas follow the same pattern: a group of people feeling responsible for a child express that they request blessing for the child, and blessing for themselves, helping them to help the child to learn. It should learn to see, to hear, to reach out, to speak, to walk, to love. In five stanzas, the ability is further described by poetic images, for example \"to see\": the mother's face, the colours of the flowers, the snow on the mountains, the country of promise. Verhei\u00dfung (promise) is the last word in all five stanzas. The last stanza is shorter, ending the poem on \"learn to love with his whole heart\" (\"dass es lieben lernt mit seinem ganzen Herzen\").The text was written in 1971. It was included in the Catholic German hymnal Gotteslob (GL) with a melody by Erna Woll (former GL 636). It was also printed in 1981 in the collection Lieder vom neuen Leben (Songs of new life).A different melody by Michael Sch\u00fctz, composed in 1983, appears in current German hymnals, both in the new Gotteslob (GL 490), as in  Protestant hymnals. The text was published also in Texte der Zuversicht by J. Pfeiffer Verlag in Munich in 1987.The text was printed again in 2012 as part of Zenetti's book Auf seiner Spur. It has been used for books and greeting cards for birth and baptism."

They prefer to live in low mountains and forests, while almost completely avoiding plains and high-altitude climates. V. mandarinia creates nests by digging, co-opting pre-existing tunnels dug by rodents, or occupying spaces near rotted pine roots. It feeds primarily on larger insects, colonies of other eusocial insects, tree sap, and honey from honey bee colonies. The hornet has a body length of 45 mm (1.8 in), a wingspan around 75 mm (3.0 in), and a stinger 6 mm (0.24 in) long, which injects a large amount of potent venom.The Asian giant hornet is sometimes confused with the yellow-legged hornet (Vespa velutina), also known as the Asian hornet, an invasive species of major concern across Europe, including the UK."
